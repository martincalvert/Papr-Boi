# Papr-Boi
A simple rails app that can be used to compose HTML emails.

# Base
This rails app comes stock using Postgres, but it should be easy to swap in another SQL db. 

# Usage
You can download this repo and run it straight from the command line. 

To do so you must have the following installed.
*Postgres,
Ruby,
Bundle*

#### Alternative Usage

###### Heroku
This app is 100% Heroku compatiable, simply fork the repo, create a heroku app then push it up. From there you will have to create a admin user through the rails console.

###### Docker
I am currently working on having a docker container for this app packaged up.

# ToDo
- Drag and Drop for modules
- User permissions
